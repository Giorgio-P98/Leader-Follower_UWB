    <!-- This file demonstrates the use of some <gazebo> tags -->

    <!-- To include it add the following line -->
    <!-- <xacro:include filename="example_gazebo.xacro" /> -->



    <!-- Gazebo is unable to use the same <material> tags that are already in the URDF (that RViz uses). -->
    <!-- Instead, we need to add gazebo tags for our links that refer to Gazebo materials -->


    <gazebo reference="base_link">
        <material>Gazebo/Green</material>
    </gazebo>


    <gazebo reference="prism_link1">
        <material>Gazebo/Green</material>
    </gazebo>

    <gazebo reference="prism_link2">
        <material>Gazebo/Red</material>
    </gazebo>





    <!-- Gazebo requires the use of plugins to interact with other systems such as ROS. -->


    <!-- This plugin will publish the joint_states for the selected joints 
            (which robot_state_publisher can then use to broadcast the approprate tf). -->

    <gazebo>
        <plugin name="gazebo_ros_joint_state_publisher"
            filename="libgazebo_ros_joint_state_publisher.so">
            <update_rate>100</update_rate>
            <joint_name>movingCubex</joint_name>
            <joint_name>movingCubey</joint_name>
        </plugin>
    </gazebo>


    <!-- This plugin will read a JointTrajectory message from the /set_joint_trajectory topic 
            and move the machine accordingly. It's a bit clunky but it works. -->
    <!-- You'll probably want to add damping to the joints to stop them it flopping around. 
            e.g. <dynamics damping="10.0" friction="10.0"/> -->
    <!-- Here's an example message to publish to test it:
            ros2 topic pub -1 /set_joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory  '{header: {frame_id: world}, joint_names: [slider_joint, arm_joint], points: [  {positions: {0.8,0.6}} ]}' -->
    <gazebo>
        <plugin name="gazebo_ros_joint_pose_trajectory"

        </plugin>
    </gazebo>







    <!-- The next section shows an example of adding a sensor, in this case a depth camera. -->

    <!-- Due to a quirk of how cameras work, an extra joint/link is required to create an
            "optical frame" for the sensor. That isn't the focus for this tutorial, but you can
            look at https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#suffix-frames for slightly more information. -->

    
    
    <!-- First, create the link and joint for the optical frame -->

    


    <!-- Add a gazebo tag for the ORIGINAL camera_link (but in the plugin we reference the optical frame so that ROS can orient things correctly) -->
    <!-- Within the gazebo tag we have the sensor tag, and inside that there is (among other things) the camera tag with the camera parameters, 
            and the plugin tag with some extra parameters the plugin needs. -->
    <!-- Note that although visualise is set to true, it won't actually visualise the depth camera in gazebo. To see the preview, 
            try swapping "depth" to "camera"-->
