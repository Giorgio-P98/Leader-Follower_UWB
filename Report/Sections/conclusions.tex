Our work, through simulations and real tests has demonstrated and validated the functioning of the solution we developed. At the same time, it is clear that there is still room for improvement. In particular, other refinements on the UWB tuning and on its firmware could provide better target pose estimation and consequently better performances. Even the way in which we use the measures could be improved, investigating filtering methods that also consider prior information about the motion of the target. \\
Also the PID setpoints generator could be better tuned, performing some optimization on its gains.
